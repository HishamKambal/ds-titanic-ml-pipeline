# Titanic Survival Prediction — End-to-End ML Pipeline

A compact, production-style machine learning project using the **Kaggle Titanic** dataset.  
This repository demonstrates a clean and reproducible ML workflow, focusing on structure,
correctness, and engineering best practices rather than leaderboard optimization.

## What this project demonstrates
- Reproducible project structure
- Data validation and preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Artifact generation (metrics, model, submission)
- One-command execution via CLI
